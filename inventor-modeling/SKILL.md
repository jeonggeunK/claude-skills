# Autodesk Inventor 2026 — Parametric Modeling via MCP

## When this skill applies

Any task involving the inventor-mcp server: `mcp__inventor__connect`, `create_part`, `extrude`, `revolve`, `hole`, `chamfer`, `fillet`, `circular_pattern`, etc. Also any direct Python work against `src/inventor_api.py` in `the inventor-mcp project root\`.

Keep explanations concrete; the result that matters is the model in Inventor, not the code.

## Token-efficient workflow (USE THESE FIRST)

The MCP server has power tools that replace ad-hoc console scripts:

- **`execute_python(code)`** — runs Python against live `inv`/`app`/`doc`/`comp`/`body`/`tg`
  objects with a persistent namespace and auto-connect. Use this instead of
  `python -c "..."` console scripts with 10 lines of import boilerplate.
- **`reload_api()`** — hot-reloads `inventor_api.py` after editing it. No Claude Code
  restart needed (new TOOL schemas still need a restart; new wrapper METHODS don't —
  call them via `execute_python`).
- **`inspect()`** — one-call part snapshot (features, volume, bbox, sketches).
- **`list_edges(min_length=...)` / `list_faces(min_area=...)`** — compact topology
  tables; no more hand-written vertex-iteration loops.
- **`transaction("begin"/"commit"/"abort")`** — wrap risky multi-step builds;
  abort rolls back everything in one call (no manual feature deletion).

Feature tools (extrude, hole, flange, ...) return an auto-report suffix like
`| V 23497 (-503 mm³) | F7 E14` — separate volume-check calls are unnecessary.

## Core mental model

| | Notes |
|---|---|
| Units | API takes **millimeters**; Inventor stores internally in **cm** (the wrapper handles ÷10 automatically) |
| Coordinates | XY is the default sketch plane. Z = "up"/axial in most templates |
| Workflow | `connect → create_part → create_sketch → draw_* → extrude/revolve → hole → fillet/chamfer → save` |
| Feature indices | 1-based, in creation order (`list_features()` to see them) |
| Edge indices | 1-based, in Inventor's internal order — **change after every feature that adds/removes edges** |

## The five rules that prevent 80% of failures

These come from real failures in past sessions. Internalize them.

### 1. Always extrude bodies in `"positive"` direction

```python
inv.extrude(13, "positive", "join")   # ✅ z = 0 .. 13
inv.extrude(13, "negative", "join")   # ❌ subtle: makes hole() not cut!
```

`hole()` is hardcoded to drill from XY plane in `kNegativeExtentDirection`. The hole's `AddDrilledByThroughAllExtent` is "through-all" — it traverses **any** body it intersects regardless of direction — **but only if the body's geometry was created normally**. With a negative-extruded body, the hole feature is created but doesn't remove material (verified by volume check). Always extrude positive; `hole()` will pass through whether body is above or below the XY plane.

### 2. `draw_polygon(radius=R, sides=6)` — `R` is the **circumradius**, not apothem

For a hex with width across flats `s`:
```python
circumradius = s / math.sqrt(3)    # M16 nut s=24 → R = 13.856
apothem      = s / 2                # = 12mm — the radial distance to flat midpoint
```

### 3. Revolve: prefer `axis="Y"` (or X/Z) over construction lines

Old way (still works): draw construction line FIRST, then profile, then `revolve(axis_line_index=1)`.

New way (preferred — added in this codebase):
```python
inv.create_sketch("XY")
inv.draw_closed_profile([[0,0],[30,0],[30,8],[15,60],[0,60]])   # profile only
inv.revolve(axis="Y", operation="join")
```

For a sketch on **XZ plane**, 2D-Y maps to **part +Z** (verified empirically). So a profile at `[[11, 13], [16, 13], [16, 10]]` revolved around `axis="Z"` chamfers material near the top of a body that goes from z=0 to z=13.

### 4. All chamfer edges go in ONE call — indices renumber after each chamfer feature

```python
# ❌ Wrong — second call uses stale indices
inv.chamfer(2, edge_indices=[5,8])
inv.chamfer(2, edge_indices=[11,14])   # these are no longer the edges you wanted!

# ✅ Right — single call with all edges
inv.chamfer(2, edge_indices=[5,8,11,14,17,20])
```

### 5. UTF-8 console + unique save filenames

```bash
python -X utf8 my_script.py    # required if script prints Cyrillic / × symbols
```

Saving over an open .ipt fails with `E_INVALIDARG (-2147024809)`. Either delete first, or use a fresh filename (`HexNut_M16_v2.ipt`).

## Common workflows — cookbook

### Stepped shaft (revolve join)

```python
inv.create_sketch("XY")
inv.draw_closed_profile([[0,0],[30,0],[30,8],[15,8],[15,60],[0,60]])   # 6-pt profile
inv.revolve(axis="Y", operation="join")
```

### Circumferential groove (revolve cut)

```python
inv.create_sketch("XY")
inv.draw_closed_profile([[8,26],[15,26],[15,34],[8,34]])    # groove cross-section
inv.revolve(axis="Y", operation="cut")
```

### Tapped hole (M-thread, standard coarse pitch auto-picked)

```python
inv.hole(x=0, y=0, diameter=16, depth=0, tapped=True)
# → M16 × 2.0 (coarse), 6H, through-all
```

For non-standard pitch: pass `pitch=1.5` explicitly (fine M16).

### Bolt-hole circle (one hole + circular pattern, NOT 8 separate holes)

```python
inv.hole(x=120, y=0, diameter=16, depth=0, tapped=True)   # one M16 at PCD 240
features = inv.list_features()
hole_idx = features[-1]["index"]
inv.circular_pattern(feature_index=hole_idx, count=8, angle=360, axis="Z")
```

### DIN 934 chamfer — done by revolve cut, NOT `chamfer()`

The `Chamfer` feature in Inventor knocks the same width off each of the 12 edges of a hex prism — creating 12 small flat facets. The real DIN 934 chamfer is a **conical** surface. Use `revolve(axis="Z", operation="cut")` with a triangle profile on the XZ plane. See sibling skill `inventor-din-parts` for full templates.

### Sheet Metal parts (PC cases, enclosures, brackets)

When the user mentions "листовий метал", "sheet metal", thickness like "0.8 мм", or wants a bent enclosure:

```python
inv.create_part(template="sheet_metal", name="My_Enclosure")
inv.set_sheet_metal_thickness(0.8)         # mm

# Base panel (the bottom / first flat piece)
inv.create_sketch("XY")
inv.draw_rectangle(0, 0, width=200, height=450)
inv.sheet_metal_face()                      # creates Sheet Metal Face1

# Add a wall — REAL Sheet Metal Flange (with bend radius, supports Flat Pattern)
front_edge = inv.find_edge(y=-225, z=0.8)   # find edge of base panel
inv.flange(edge_indices=[front_edge], distance=450, angle=90)
# After each flange, edge indices renumber. Re-find before next flange:
back_edge = inv.find_edge(y=+225, z=0.8)
inv.flange(edge_indices=[back_edge], distance=450, angle=90)
# ...etc for left/right

# Cutouts on a panel — ONE sketch on the panel face, ALL shapes, ONE Sheet Metal Cut
back_face = inv.find_face(y=225, min_area=10000)   # outer back face
inv.create_sketch(face_index=back_face)
inv.draw_circle(x=100, y=130, diameter=120)        # fan hole
inv.draw_rectangle(x=100, y=32.5, width=158, height=45)   # IO panel
inv.draw_rectangle(x=100, y=377, width=150, height=86)    # PSU
inv.sheet_metal_cut()       # cut depth = Thickness automatically (parametric!)
```

**Three rules for sheet metal that prevent rework:**

1. **Cuts must be Sheet Metal Cut, not Extrude cut.** Sheet Metal Cut binds depth to the
   `Thickness` parameter. Changing thickness later updates all cuts automatically.
   Extrude cut uses a fixed depth → cuts become wrong when thickness changes.

2. **Sketch for a Cut goes ON the panel face, not on a work plane.** Sketching on the
   face is what lets Inventor default the cut depth to `Thickness`. Use
   `inv.find_face(y=…, z=…)` to locate the right face, then `create_sketch(face_index=N)`.

3. **All cutouts on the same panel go in ONE sketch.** One sketch with multiple closed
   loops (circles, rectangles) becomes ONE `Cut1` feature with all holes. This is the
   Inventor convention — multiple separate Cut features add visual clutter and slower
   rebuild.

**Coordinates on a panel face** are NOT centered. The sketch origin is at one corner
of the face, and axes may flip relative to world. To convert:
```python
pt3d = sketch.SketchToModelSpace(tg.CreatePoint2d(sx_cm, sy_cm))
# Returns world position in cm
```
For a typical back face at Y=+225 (outer normal +Y), the mapping is often
`sketch_X = world_X + half_width`, `sketch_Y = top_world_Z - world_Z` (flipped).
Confirm via `SketchToModelSpace` for the actual face.

**Flange API quirks** (Inventor 2026 — verified empirically):
- `CreateFlangeDefinition(Edges, AngleRadians, DistanceIgnored)` — second arg must be
  RADIANS (`math.radians(90)` → 1.5708), not degrees. Pass `90` and Inventor stores 5156°.
- The Distance argument is silently IGNORED — the flange always defaults to 25mm height.
- Real distance set via `feat.Definition.HeightExtent.Distance.Expression = "450 mm"`.
- `inv.flange()` already handles all of the above — just pass `distance` in mm.
- HeightDatumType=75521 ("From Outer Intersection") is the default. With this datum,
  Distance equals the visible perpendicular height (thickness not subtracted).

**Flat Pattern test** — the proof that a sheet metal model is truly parametric:
Right-click the body → "Create Flat Pattern". If the model unfolds into a 2D layout
with all cuts visible, the geometry is real sheet metal. If it fails, you have
solid extrusions in a sheet metal document (visually identical but not usable).

### Parametric sketch discipline (required for maintainable models)

Every sketch must end up **Fully Constrained**. The pattern:

```python
sketch = comp.Sketches.Add(comp.WorkPlanes.Item(3))
# 1. Project the origin point — dimensions will reference it
proj = sketch.AddByProjectingEntity(comp.WorkPoints.Item(1))
try: proj_o = proj.Item(1)
except: proj_o = proj
# 2. Project axes as construction lines (for symmetry / coincident constraints)
r = sketch.AddByProjectingEntity(comp.WorkAxes.Item(1))
proj_x = r.Item(1); proj_x.Construction = True

# 3. Base sketch of a symmetric part → SYMMETRY about projected axes
gc = sketch.GeometricConstraints
gc.AddSymmetry(left_line, right_line, proj_y_axis)   # part stays centered on origin

# 4. Circle center on an axis → coincident, NOT a zero dimension
gc.AddCoincident(circle.CenterSketchPoint, proj_x)

# 5. Dimensions from the projected origin (works with projected points!)
dc = sketch.DimensionConstraints
dc.AddTwoPointDistance(proj_o, circle.CenterSketchPoint, 19201, text_pt)  # horizontal
```

Why: change one dimension → the whole part rebuilds correctly.

**Rename features and sketches immediately** (`feat.Name = 'Bore20'`,
`sketch.Name = 'sk_bore20'`): Inventor numbers Sketch/Extrusion globally and never
reuses deleted numbers, so auto-names like "Sketch4" are unreliable references.

### Hole placement: Linear (edge-referenced) — preferred for fastener holes

`inv.hole_linear()` places a hole at distances from two edges of a face — fully
parametric (survives part resizing). Discovered signature (gencache):

```python
placement = hf.CreateLinearPlacementDefinition(
    face, edge1, dist1_cm, edge2, dist2_cm,
    bias_point)   # ← Point3d REQUIRED via dynamic dispatch; approximate hole location
# bias disambiguates among 4 possible positions (distance can go either side of edge)
```

**Drill direction is unpredictable** — kPositive vs kNegative depends on face
orientation. Pattern: create → `doc.Update()` → check `MassProperties.Volume`
dropped → if not, delete feature and retry with the other direction.
`inv.hole_linear()` does this automatically.

### Counterbore + split-clamp screw pattern (ISO 4762)

```python
# AddCBoreByDistanceExtent(placement, HoleDiaOrTapInfo, Depth, Direction, CBoreDia, CBoreDepth)
hf.AddCBoreByDistanceExtent(pl, 0.55, 1.125, 20993, 1.0, 0.55)  # all cm
```

M5 socket head cap screw (ISO 4762, DIN, Normal fit): clearance Ø5.5, cbore Ø10×5.5.

Split clamp (розрізний хомут) screw = TWO hole features:
- Near ear: clearance + counterbore, depth = ear thickness (to the slot)
- Far ear: tapped M5 (TapInfo works with `AddDrilledByDistanceExtent` too), depth = ear

Via the wrapper: `inv.hole_linear(..., diameter=5.5, depth=11.25, cbore_diameter=10, cbore_depth=5.5)`
then `inv.hole_linear(...opposite face..., diameter=5, depth=11.25, tapped=True)`.

### Offset work planes — features at a height

```python
inv.create_sketch(plane="XY", offset=16)   # hidden work plane 16mm above XY
# Raw API: comp.WorkPlanes.AddByPlaneAndOffset(basePlane, offset_cm); wp.Visible=False
# Offset direction = plane normal (XY→+Z, XZ→+Y, YZ→+X)
# Always verify with sketch.SketchToModelSpace(tg.CreatePoint2d(0,0))
```
Offset planes from XY have DIRECT axis mapping (x→X, y→Y), unlike base XZ.

### Fillets shift adjacent edges (topology trap)

After a fillet, adjacent edges get extended/shortened — their midpoints move.
(Verified: R20 fillet extended neighbouring slope edges from Y 17..33 to Y −3..33.)
Re-find edges with `list_edges`/`find_edge` AFTER every fillet; never reuse
pre-fillet coordinates.

### Feature order vs cuts

Material added AFTER a cut (bore/hole) will FILL the cut where they overlap.
When adding a rib/boss under an already-bored hub, stop the new feature below
the bore bottom (e.g., rib top Z=65 when bore bottom is Z=70), or reorder features.

### Reading technical drawings — practical conventions

1. Dimensions that look horizontal/vertical ARE exactly that unless noted.
2. Symmetric parts: a dimension may be shown on one side only — mirror it.
3. Unspecified fillet radii: estimate by comparing against known drawing elements,
   round to a multiple of 5.
4. "Extend the face line virtually" — a slanted face's extension often passes
   through a part corner (gives the tangent anchor point).
5. Typical bearing-bracket construction: triangular gusset plate at the back
   + stiffening rib at the front under the boss, both the same thickness.
6. When a dimension is unclear (e.g. "14" between centers) — ASK the user,
   never guess. Humans read drawings better than models do.

### Sketch axis mapping on standard work planes

| Plane | sketch X | sketch Y |
|---|---|---|
| XY (Item 3) | world +X | world +Y |
| XZ (Item 2) | **world −X (mirrored!)** | world +Z |
| YZ (Item 1) | world +Y | world +Z |

Verify with `sketch.SketchToModelSpace(tg.CreatePoint2d(1,0))` when unsure.

### SaveAs vs Save

`doc.SaveAs(path)` fails with E_INVALIDARG when the file is already open under that
name. Re-saves go through `doc.Save()` (wrapper: `inv.save_document()` with no path).

### Type library / gencache for API discovery

When dynamic dispatch returns `Type mismatch` and you can't figure out what types
the API wants, you can run a probe via `gencache.EnsureDispatch` in a separate
Python process. This gives you typed bindings with full inspectable signatures.

```python
# probe_typelib.py — run in a SEPARATE process, then DELETE the gen_py cache
from win32com.client import gencache, CastTo
import inspect
app = gencache.EnsureDispatch("Inventor.Application")
part_doc = CastTo(app.ActiveDocument, "PartDocument")
comp = CastTo(part_doc.ComponentDefinition, "SheetMetalComponentDefinition")
smf = CastTo(comp.Features, "SheetMetalFeatures")
for m in dir(type(smf.FlangeFeatures)):
    if m.startswith("_"): continue
    attr = getattr(type(smf.FlangeFeatures), m)
    if callable(attr):
        print(f"{m}{inspect.signature(attr)}")
```

After the probe, **always** delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\gen_py\3.12` (or your Python
version) — otherwise `GetActiveObject` in subsequent sessions fails with
`KeyError: '_dispobj_'`. Verified the hard way.

## Diagnostic patterns — verify the build did what you intended

Don't trust "feature created successfully" — sometimes the feature is created but doesn't remove material (the through-hole problem above). Verify geometry:

```python
import win32com.client
app = win32com.client.GetActiveObject("Inventor.Application")
body = app.ActiveDocument.ComponentDefinition.SurfaceBodies.Item(1)
mp   = app.ActiveDocument.ComponentDefinition.MassProperties

print(f"Volume = {mp.Volume*1000:.0f} mm³")     # cm³ → mm³
print(f"Faces = {body.Faces.Count}")
print(f"Edges = {body.Edges.Count}")
rb = body.RangeBox
print(f"Z: {rb.MinPoint.Z*10:.2f} .. {rb.MaxPoint.Z*10:.2f} mm")
```

**Face SurfaceType decoder** (Inventor 2026):
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 5890 | Plane |
| 5891 | Cylinder |
| 5892 | Cone (sometimes appears as 5893) |
| 5893 | Cone (variant) |
| 5894 | Sphere |
| 5895 | Torus |

Finding the chamfer in `Face types: {'Plane': 8, 'Cylinder': 1, 'Cone': 2}` confirms revolve-cut produced real conical surfaces.

**Finding edges by Z coordinate** (e.g. shaft tip):
```python
for i in range(1, body.Edges.Count + 1):
    e = body.Edges.Item(i)
    z_mid = (e.StartVertex.Point.Z + e.StopVertex.Point.Z) / 2.0 * 10
    if abs(z_mid - target_z) < 1:
        print(f"Edge {i} at Z={z_mid:.1f}mm")
```

## Inventor 2026 API gotchas (vs older docs)

These differ from the official documentation and older Inventor versions — the docs are wrong for 2026.

| | Old / docs | Inventor 2026 actually wants |
|---|---|---|
| DocumentType | varies | `12290` for parts |
| Direction enum | varies | `20993/20994/20995` (pos/neg/sym) |
| Operation enum | varies | `20481/20482/20483/20484/20485` (join/cut/intersect/surface/new) |
| Dimension orientation | `40706/40707/40708` (docs) | `19201/19202/19203` (horiz/vert/aligned) |
| Chamfer API | `CreateChamferDefinition` + `Add` | `ChamferFeatures.AddUsingDistance(EdgeCollection, d)` — note `EdgeCollection`, not `ObjectCollection` |
| Revolve API | `CreateRevolveDefinition` | `RevolveFeatures.AddFull(profile, axis, op)` |
| Hole API | `CreateSimpleHoleDef` | `HoleFeatures.CreateSketchPlacementDefinition(ObjectCollection of SketchPoints)` |
| AddTwoPointDistance | any SketchPoint | **only** line endpoints — `line.StartSketchPoint` / `line.EndSketchPoint`. Standalone `SketchPoints.Add()` gives E_UNEXPECTED |

## Sketch dimension cookbook

Sketches without dimensions are "underdefined" (yellow status in Inventor). To get fully-defined sketches:

```python
# AddDiameter — built into draw_circle() already
inv.draw_circle(0, 0, 50)   # adds diameter dim automatically

# Position dimension on a SketchPoint — needs a separate sketch with a construction line
# (because HoleFeature consumes its placement sketch — adding lines there breaks it)
```

`hole()` already calls `_add_hole_position_dims` to add X/Y position dims via a separate dimension sketch — no extra work needed.

## TapInfo for threaded holes

Standard coarse-pitch table (auto-applied when `pitch` is omitted):

| Thread | Pitch | Thread | Pitch |
|---|---|---|---|
| M6  | 1.0  | M16 | 2.0  |
| M8  | 1.25 | M20 | 2.5  |
| M10 | 1.5  | M24 | 3.0  |
| M12 | 1.75 | M30 | 3.5  |
| M14 | 2.0  | M36 | 4.0  |

Designation format: **integer pitches drop the decimal** — `M16x2` not `M16x2.0`. The `hole()` wrapper handles this. ThreadType string must be **exactly** `"ISO Metric profile"` (from `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2026\Design Data\XLS\en-US\thread.xlsx`).

## File locations

| | Path |
|---|---|
| MCP server | `src/server.py` |
| API wrapper | `src/inventor_api.py` |

| Templates | `app.FileLocations.TemplatesPath` (auto-resolved) |
| Thread DB | `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2026\Design Data\XLS\en-US\thread.xlsx` |


## When user reports "feature didn't work"

1. **First** verify with the diagnostic block above — is the volume / face count what you'd expect?
2. **If hole didn't cut**: check the extrude direction. Was it `"negative"`? Rebuild with `"positive"`.
3. **If chamfer failed**: was `CreateChamferDefinition` used somewhere? Replace with `AddUsingDistance(EdgeCollection, d)`.
4. **If revolve cut had no effect**: profile was probably in air (wrong Z side). Flip the sign of Y coords in the profile.
5. **If second chamfer destroyed first**: you passed two separate `chamfer()` calls. Combine into one with all edge indices.

## MCP server restart caveat

After editing `inventor_api.py` or `server.py`, the **running MCP server still uses the old code** (Python loads modules on startup). Either restart Claude Code, or run the script via plain `python -X utf8 my_script.py` — direct Python imports the latest module file.

The `mcp__inventor__*` tools will return outputs in the OLD format string until restart, even though the underlying logic may have changed.
